# Code Review for argento-dev-pgw-report-api\Argento.ReportingService.DL\Reconciles\ReportType.cs

Here's the code review based on the provided C# code for the `ReportType` class:

### Code Review Summary

**Correctness and Functionality**
- **Score: 10/10**
- **Explanation:** The code defines a straightforward data model with two properties (Id and Name). There are no logical errors, and it complies with expected functionality for a data class.

**Code Quality and Maintainability**
- **Score: 9/10**
- **Explanation:** The code is clear and well-structured. The use of properties is appropriate, and the class name is descriptive. However, a public constructor or at least a method could be added to allow creation of instances with required parameters.
- **Improvement Suggestion:** Consider adding a constructor that initializes the `Id` and `Name` properties to enhance maintainability.

**Performance and Efficiency**
- **Score: 10/10**
- **Explanation:** The class has minimal resource footprint, containing only two properties with no complexities. 

**Security and Vulnerability Assessment**
- **Score: 10/10**
- **Explanation:** There are no apparent security issues within this context as it does not involve external input or operationsâ€”it's merely a data representation.

**Code Consistency and Style**
- **Score: 10/10**
- **Explanation:** The code adheres to typical C# conventions (naming, spacing, and overall structure). The naming of the class and properties are consistent with .NET standards.

**Scalability and Extensibility**
- **Score: 9/10**
- **Explanation:** The class is highly extensible as it stands. Future updates or changes can be easily incorporated since it's a basic data structure.
- **Improvement Suggestion:** If this class is expected to evolve or hold more complex functionalities in the future, consider using interfaces or inheritance patterns to allow for scalability.

**Error Handling and Robustness**
- **Score: 10/10**
- **Explanation:** Since this class is a straightforward data model, there are no areas requiring error handling.

### Overall Score: 9.86/10

### Code Improvement Summary:
1. **Constructor Addition:** Introduce a constructor that allows for initializing `Id` and `Name` upon instantiation, which could help with creating instances with necessary data.
2. **Future Extensibility:** If this class will expand in functionality, consider planning for interfaces or abstract classes to enable future modifications without breaking changes.

The code is already very high-quality, but implementing these suggestions could enhance its functionality and maintainability.
