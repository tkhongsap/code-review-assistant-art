# Code Review for argento-dev-pgw-report-api\Argento.ReportingService.DL\Reconciles\ReconcileCancelRequest.cs

## Code Review Summary

### Correctness and Functionality
**Score: 10/10**  
**Explanation:** The code correctly defines a class `ReconcileCancelRequest` with two string properties: `reconcileProcessId` and `remark`. There are no logical errors, and the functionality is straightforward, adhering to its intended purpose.

### Code Quality and Maintainability
**Score: 8/10**  
**Explanation:** The code is simple and easily understandable. However, the naming convention for the properties follows camel case (e.g., `reconcileProcessId`) rather than the typical C# Pascal case (e.g., `ReconcileProcessId`). Consistency with standard naming conventions would improve maintainability.  
**Improvement Suggestion:** Change the property names to Pascal case: `ReconcileProcessId`, `Remark`.

### Performance and Efficiency
**Score: 10/10**  
**Explanation:** The code is efficient for its purpose. Since it solely defines a data structure, there are no performance concerns.

### Security and Vulnerability Assessment
**Score: 10/10**  
**Explanation:** The class does not expose any security vulnerabilities. Since it only contains string properties and does not include any sensitive operations or input handling, it is inherently secure in its current form.

### Code Consistency and Style
**Score: 8/10**  
**Explanation:** The code follows basic organization principles but could benefit from improved adherence to naming conventions. There is overall consistency in the code structure.  
**Improvement Suggestion:** Apply Pascal case to property names for better style consistency.

### Scalability and Extensibility
**Score: 9/10**  
**Explanation:** The class is straightforward and can serve as a basis for future extensions if necessary. Since it's a data container, it can easily be modified to include additional properties or methods. A small note is that if more complex functionality is to be added later, consider implementing constructor overloads or validation methods.  

### Error Handling and Robustness
**Score: 10/10**  
**Explanation:** This class does not contain any methods that could throw exceptions or require error handling, and thus, robustness is not applicable here. The current state is sufficient for a data model.

### Code Improvement Summary:
1. **Naming Conventions:** Change the property names from camel case to Pascal case to adhere to C# naming conventions:
   - `reconcileProcessId` ➔ `ReconcileProcessId`
   - `remark` ➔ `Remark`

By implementing these improvements, you can enhance the readability and maintainability of the code while ensuring that it aligns with best practices for C#.
