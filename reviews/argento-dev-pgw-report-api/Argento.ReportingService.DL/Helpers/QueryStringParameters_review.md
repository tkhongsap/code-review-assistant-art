# Code Review for argento-dev-pgw-report-api\Argento.ReportingService.DL\Helpers\QueryStringParameters.cs

Hereâ€™s a detailed review of the provided C# code along with individual scores for each dimension and improvement suggestions:

### Code Review Summary

**Correctness and Functionality**  
**Score: 9/10**  
**Explanation:** The code appears to operate correctly given its intended functionality for handling pagination parameters with default values for `maxPageSize`, `Page`, and `PageSize`. There are no logical errors present.  
**Improvement Suggestion:** Consider adding validation constraints in the `PageSize` setter to ensure values remain within acceptable limits (e.g., `maxPageSize`).

---

**Code Quality and Maintainability**  
**Score: 8/10**  
**Explanation:** The code is generally well-structured with proper property encapsulation. Naming conventions are appropriate, but property names should start with an uppercase letter to conform to C# coding standards.  
**Improvement Suggestion:** Change `maxPageSize`, `Page`, and `PageSize` to `MaxPageSize`, `Page`, and `PageSize`. This would enhance consistency with C# naming conventions.

---

**Performance and Efficiency**  
**Score: 10/10**  
**Explanation:** The code is efficient for its purpose. There are no unnecessary computations or resource-intensive operations involved.  
**Improvement Suggestion:** Maintain existing performance as no improvements are needed.

---

**Security and Vulnerability Assessment**  
**Score: 8/10**  
**Explanation:** The code does not present any immediate security vulnerabilities, but it lacks input validation, which could potentially lead to issues if misused elsewhere in the application.  
**Improvement Suggestion:** Implement input validation within the properties, particularly for `PageSize`, to avoid unintended values that might exceed logical limits.

---

**Code Consistency and Style**  
**Score: 7/10**  
**Explanation:** The code follows a consistent style for the most part but does not adhere to established C# naming conventions, as mentioned earlier.  
**Improvement Suggestion:** Ensure all identifiers follow C# guidelines, including property names starting with an uppercase letter.

---

**Scalability and Extensibility**  
**Score: 7/10**  
**Explanation:** The current implementation supports basic functionality, but as new features may be added in the future, it might need more modularization.  
**Improvement Suggestion:** Consider separating the default values into a configuration object or constants to ease future extensions.

---

**Error Handling and Robustness**  
**Score: 6/10**  
**Explanation:** There is no error handling implemented in the properties. While the current logic is simple, it lacks robustness against invalid state when setting properties.  
**Improvement Suggestion:** Add error handling or constraints in the properties to guard against invalid values (e.g., negative values for `PageSize`).

---

### Overall Score: 7.57/10

### Code Improvement Summary:
1. **Naming Conventions:** Update property names to follow C# conventions (e.g., `MaxPageSize`, `PageSize`).
2. **Input Validation:** Implement input validation in the `PageSize` setter to restrict values within acceptable ranges.
3. **Error Handling:** Provide error handling for setting properties to manage invalid states effectively.
4. **Modularity:** Consider using a configuration class or constants to manage default values, enhancing scalability and extensibility in the future.

By implementing these suggestions, the overall quality, maintainability, and robustness of the code can be significantly improved.
