# Code Review for argento-dev-pgw-report-api\Argento.ReportingService.DL\Users\RequestedUser.cs

Hereâ€™s a detailed review of the provided code:

### Code Review Summary

**Correctness and Functionality**  
**Score: 9/10**  
**Explanation:** The code correctly defines a simple class `RequestedUser` in C#. It initializes its properties `Id` and `Username`, and there are no logical errors. However, for maximum correctness, additional validation (e.g., checking for null or empty values) could be implemented on these properties if required by the application.  
**Improvement Suggestion:** Consider adding input validation for the properties if they're susceptible to invalid values in future implementations.

---

**Code Quality and Maintainability**  
**Score: 9/10**  
**Explanation:** The class is simple and easy to understand, following good naming conventions. It adheres to clean code principles by being concise and clear. However, it could benefit from implementing read-only properties with setters only for improved encapsulation.  
**Improvement Suggestion:** Consider making the properties private set or using a constructor for initialization to enforce immutability if appropriate for your use case.

---

**Performance and Efficiency**  
**Score: 10/10**  
**Explanation:** The code performs efficiently for its requirements given the simplicity of its operations. There are no unnecessary computations or resource-heavy actions.  
**Improvement Suggestion:** None, the performance is optimal given the current scope.

---

**Security and Vulnerability Assessment**  
**Score: 10/10**  
**Explanation:** There are no apparent security issues present in this code snippet as it does not involve any user input or data manipulation that could introduce vulnerabilities.  
**Improvement Suggestion:** None needed for this simple class.

---

**Code Consistency and Style**  
**Score: 10/10**  
**Explanation:** The code follows consistent styling rules and naming conventions, making it easy to read and understand. The use of namespaces is appropriate.  
**Improvement Suggestion:** None, styling and consistency are well maintained.

---

**Scalability and Extensibility**  
**Score: 8/10**  
**Explanation:** The class is minimal and may need to be extended depending on future requirements. However, without knowing more about potential use cases or expansion plans, it's challenging to recommend specific improvements.  
**Improvement Suggestion:** As requirements grow, consider adding methods for manipulating the `RequestedUser` data or implementing interfaces if needed for extensibility.

---

**Error Handling and Robustness**  
**Score: 7/10**  
**Explanation:** The class does not include error handling, but it is a simple data class and may not require complex error management. There are no checks or exceptions defined for property assignments, which could lead to potential errors later if null strings are mismanaged.  
**Improvement Suggestion:** If it becomes part of a larger system, consider implementing validation logic or making property setters more robust against invalid data.

---

### Overall Score: 8.71/10

### Code Improvement Summary:
1. **Input Validation:** Consider adding validation to the properties if invalid data might be a concern.
2. **Encapsulation:** Adjust properties to be read-only if immutability is desired in the context of your application.
3. **Error Handling:** If this class grows in complexity or is used in critical operations, incorporate error handling or validation mechanisms.

Overall, the code is straightforward and meets good standards, with minor suggestions for future improvements as complexity increases.
