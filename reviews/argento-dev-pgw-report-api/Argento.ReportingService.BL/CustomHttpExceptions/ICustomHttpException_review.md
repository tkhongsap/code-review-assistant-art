# Code Review for argento-dev-pgw-report-api\Argento.ReportingService.BL\CustomHttpExceptions\ICustomHttpException.cs

Hereâ€™s the code review for the provided C# code snippet:

### Code Review Summary

**Correctness and Functionality**  
**Score: 9/10**  
**Explanation:** The code correctly defines an interface `ICustomHttpException` that outlines expected properties for custom HTTP exceptions. It's logically sound and provides a clear contract for implementation. However, it could be tested in the context of actual implementations to ensure the properties are applied correctly.  
**Improvement Suggestion:** Consider adding XML documentation comments to provide information about the intended use of this interface for developers.

---

**Code Quality and Maintainability**  
**Score: 8/10**  
**Explanation:** The code adheres to standard naming conventions for C# interfaces. The properties are clearly defined, making it easy to understand the purpose of the interface. However, since it's an interface without any implementation, it's difficult to judge maintainability without seeing how it's utilized.  
**Improvement Suggestion:** If this interface is part of a larger system, ensure that its implementation adheres to the same quality standards and document the relationship between implementations clearly.

---

**Performance and Efficiency**  
**Score: 10/10**  
**Explanation:** Performance isn't impacted by the code provided, as it's a pure definition of an interface. It doesn't contain any logic or resource-consuming operations.  

---

**Security and Vulnerability Assessment**  
**Score: 10/10**  
**Explanation:** As an interface, there are no direct security vulnerabilities present. However, the implementation should consider the security of error responses within custom exceptions to avoid unintentional data exposure.  

---

**Code Consistency and Style**  
**Score: 9/10**  
**Explanation:** The code is well-structured and follows C# conventions for namespaces and interfaces. The naming is clear and consistent. However, the use of public access modifiers in interface members is redundant, as interface members are public by default.  
**Improvement Suggestion:** Remove the `public` modifier in front of interface members for conciseness.

---

**Scalability and Extensibility**  
**Score: 8/10**  
**Explanation:** This interface can easily accommodate new properties or methods in the future. Its simple structure makes it extensible for various implementations tailored to different HTTP error responses.   

---

**Error Handling and Robustness**  
**Score: N/A**  
**Explanation:** As an interface, error handling is not directly relevant. However, implementations are expected to handle various error scenarios, which should be assessed in a wider context of how this interface is used.  

---

### Overall Score: 8.57/10

### Code Improvement Summary:
1. **Documentation:** Add XML documentation comments to describe the purpose of the interface and its intended usage.
2. **Code Consistency:** Remove the public access modifier in the interface properties for conciseness since it's unnecessary.
3. **Implementations Review:** Ensure that any classes implementing this interface follow secure practices concerning exception handling and data exposure. 

This review demonstrates the quality of the interface definition and highlights areas for improvement, especially concerning documentation and consistency.
