# Code Review for argento-dev-pgw-report-api\Argento.ReportingService.BL\CustomHttpExceptions\TransactionNotFoundException.cs

Here is a detailed review of the provided C# code for the `TransactionNotFoundException` class:

### Code Review Summary

**Correctness and Functionality**  
**Score: 9/10**  
**Explanation:** The `TransactionNotFoundException` class correctly extends the `Exception` class and implements the `ICustomHttpException` interface (assuming this interface is defined correctly elsewhere). The constructor properly initializes the base exception with a descriptive message, and the properties provide relevant status information. There don't appear to be any logical errors.
**Improvement Suggestion:** Ensure that the `ICustomHttpException` interface is implemented correctly and includes necessary members that align with standard practices for custom exceptions.

---

**Code Quality and Maintainability**  
**Score: 8/10**  
**Explanation:** The code is structured clearly and follows decent conventions (e.g., proper use of access modifiers, readable property names). However, it uses private fields that could potentially be converted into automatic properties for better readability.
**Improvement Suggestion:** Consider converting `_StatusCode`, `_RespCode`, and `_RespDesc` into public or protected auto-properties to enhance clarity and reduce boilerplate code.

---

**Performance and Efficiency**  
**Score: 10/10**  
**Explanation:** The class does not contain unnecessary computations or overhead. It uses simple property accessors to retrieve the exception information. There are no performance issues present.
**Improvement Suggestion:** None necessary for performance; it's efficient as is.

---

**Security and Vulnerability Assessment**  
**Score: 10/10**  
**Explanation:** The code does not present any immediate security vulnerabilities. It does not accept external input that could lead to injection or exposure issues, as it is a custom exception.
**Improvement Suggestion:** Continue to maintain stringent practices if the error messages are ever exposed externally; ensure they do not reveal sensitive information.

---

**Code Consistency and Style**  
**Score: 9/10**  
**Explanation:** The code follows C# naming conventions and is consistent in style. However, the usage of underscores for private fields could follow a more conventional naming approach of using camelCase. 
**Improvement Suggestion:** Consider adopting a consistent naming approach, such as using camelCase for private fields (e.g., `statusCode`, `respCode`, and `respDesc`).

---

**Scalability and Extensibility**  
**Score: 7/10**  
**Explanation:** While the exception class serves its purpose, any future modifications that might require adding new fields or methods could lead to complications if changes are needed in multiple places.
**Improvement Suggestion:** Consider implementing factory methods or builder patterns if you expect to have many similar custom exceptions to aid in extensibility.

---

**Error Handling and Robustness**  
**Score: 10/10**  
**Explanation:** The exception is well-defined for its purpose. It does not need additional error handling specifically, as it already derives from the `Exception` class, which includes built-in mechanisms.
**Improvement Suggestion:** Maintain robust documentation or comments if the class will be used extensively, ensuring future developers understand its intended use.

---

### Overall Score: 8.71/10

### Code Improvement Summary:
1. **Auto-Properties**: Convert private fields into auto-properties for clarity and reduced code.
2. **Variable Naming**: Consider changing private field names to use camelCase to align with conventional C# practices.
3. **Scalability**: Consider factory methods or builder patterns for extensibility if more custom exceptions are anticipated in the future.

Overall, the code is well-structured and fulfills its purpose as a custom exception. Minor improvements can enhance readability and maintainability.
