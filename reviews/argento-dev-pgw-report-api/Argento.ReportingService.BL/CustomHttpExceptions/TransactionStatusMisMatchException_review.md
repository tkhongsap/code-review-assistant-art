# Code Review for argento-dev-pgw-report-api\Argento.ReportingService.BL\CustomHttpExceptions\TransactionStatusMisMatchException.cs

Here's the detailed review of the provided C# code:

### Code Review Summary

**Correctness and Functionality**  
**Score: 9/10**  
**Explanation:** The code correctly defines a custom exception class that implements the `ICustomHttpException` interface. The `TransactionStatusMisMatchException` provides meaningful status code, response code, and description. It functions as expected without any logical errors or bugs.  
**Improvement Suggestion:** Ensure that the interface `ICustomHttpException` is correctly implemented and provides the necessary definition for its methods/properties.

**Code Quality and Maintainability**  
**Score: 8/10**  
**Explanation:** The code is generally organized and adheres to clean code principles. Naming conventions are clear and follow C# standards. However, the constants could be made public or internal for better accessibility if they are intended to be used outside this class.  
**Improvement Suggestion:** Consider encapsulating the response-related properties in a separate class or struct to enhance clarity and maintainability.

**Performance and Efficiency**  
**Score: 10/10**  
**Explanation:** The performance is efficient as the class is lightweight, and the only resources utilized are basic properties and a single string message during instantiation.  
**Improvement Suggestion:** None required in this dimension.

**Security and Vulnerability Assessment**  
**Score: 10/10**  
**Explanation:** There are no visible security vulnerabilities in this code. It properly encapsulates its data and does not expose sensitive information.  
**Improvement Suggestion:** None required in this dimension.

**Code Consistency and Style**  
**Score: 9/10**  
**Explanation:** The code adheres to consistent naming conventions, indentation, and formatting standards typical of C#. There is use of private fields with underscores, which is common; however, consistency in using public properties or fields would be beneficial.  
**Improvement Suggestion:** Consider adopting a consistent naming style for private variables (either use underscores consistently or drop them across all).

**Scalability and Extensibility**  
**Score: 8/10**  
**Explanation:** This class is simple and can be easily extended if more exceptions are required. However, multiple similar custom exceptions could lead to code duplication if not managed correctly.  
**Improvement Suggestion:** Create a base custom exception class for common properties if more custom exceptions are introduced in the future.

**Error Handling and Robustness**  
**Score: 9/10**  
**Explanation:** The class properly extends the base `Exception` class, making it robust in terms of error handling. The message provided is clear and informative.  
**Improvement Suggestion:** Consider adding a constructor that allows for specifying a custom message for more granularity when throwing the exception.

### Overall Score: 8.71/10

### Code Improvement Summary:
1. **Review Interface Implementation:** Ensure `ICustomHttpException` has proper definitions that this class should fulfill.
2. **Response Handling Encapsulation:** Consider moving response code and description to a separate structure or class for better organization.
3. **Private Variable Naming Consistency:** Align the naming convention for private fields to either consistently use underscores or not.
4. **Create Base Custom Exception Class:** If more custom exceptions are anticipated, implement a base class to reduce code duplication.
5. **Custom Message Constructor:** Add an additional constructor to allow passing custom messages when throwing the exception. 

Implementing these suggestions would enhance the overall structure, maintainability, and future scalability of the code.
