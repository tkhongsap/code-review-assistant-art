# Code Review for argento-dev-pgw-report-api\Argento.ReportingService.Utility\Utils\FileUtil.cs

Here's a detailed review and evaluation of the provided C# code based on the outlined dimensions.

### Code Review Summary

**Correctness and Functionality**  
**Score: 8/10**  
**Explanation:** The code generally operates correctly and provides the expected functionality for file and directory management. However, potential issues arise in `DeleteDirectory` where it does not handle exceptions that may occur during file deletions (e.g., if a file is in use). This could lead to unhandled exceptions and unexpected behavior.
**Improvement Suggestion:** Implement try-catch blocks in `DeleteDirectory` to handle potential access issues gracefully.

**Code Quality and Maintainability**  
**Score: 8/10**  
**Explanation:** The code is modular and follows clean code principles. Methods are concise and focus on single tasks. However, the branches in some methods could be refactored to a common utility function to reduce code duplication.
**Improvement Suggestion:** Extract the directory existence check and creation logic into a separate method to encapsulate that functionality.

**Performance and Efficiency**  
**Score: 7/10**  
**Explanation:** The code performs adequately for most routines, but the use of `File.ReadAllBytes` and `File.WriteAllBytes` may impact performance with large files, as it loads the entire file into memory at once.
**Improvement Suggestion:** Consider using `FileStream` for reading and writing large files to optimize memory usage.

**Security and Vulnerability Assessment**  
**Score: 7/10**  
**Explanation:** There is a potential risk in `GetFileChecksum` where the file is read entirely into memory, which could lead to denial of service if large files are processed, and no input validation is performed on `filePath`.
**Improvement Suggestion:** Validate `filePath` against system constraints, and ensure handling of large files or potential exceptions during file reading.

**Code Consistency and Style**  
**Score: 9/10**  
**Explanation:** The code uses consistent naming conventions and formatting. Comments could enhance clarity, especially in public methods, but overall, it adheres to standard C# coding conventions.
**Improvement Suggestion:** Consider adding XML documentation comments for public methods to improve readability and provide context to users.

**Scalability and Extensibility**  
**Score: 8/10**  
**Explanation:** The class is designed with a focus on extensibility through interface implementation. However, adding new functionality could require adding methods to the existing interface, which may not always follow the Open/Closed Principle.
**Improvement Suggestion:** Consider using patterns such as Strategy or Command to better accommodate future extensions without modifying existing code.

**Error Handling and Robustness**  
**Score: 6/10**  
**Explanation:** The code lacks comprehensive error handling in certain areas, particularly in file system operations such as deleting files or directories, where exceptions may occur and cause crashes if not properly managed.
**Improvement Suggestion:** Improve overall robustness by adding comprehensive error handling, logging, and checks to ensure successful operation of methods.

### Overall Score: 7.57/10

### Code Improvement Summary:
1. **Error Handling:** Add try-catch blocks in `DeleteDirectory` for better exception handling when deleting files.
2. **Code Duplication:** Extract common directory existence check and creation logic into a utility method.
3. **Performance Optimization:** Use `FileStream` for reading and writing large files to optimize memory usage.
4. **Input Validation:** Implement validation and handling for `filePath` in `GetFileChecksum` to mitigate potential risks associated with large files and invalid paths.
5. **Documentation:** Add XML documentation comments for all public methods for improved clarity and maintainability.

This review highlights the strengths and areas for improvement, providing actionable suggestions for enhancing the code's quality and adherence to best practices.
